This is a starter project of NextJS with Supabase and authentication that we will be turning into an AI assistant

Use shadcn for all visual elements

Use lucide-react for all icons

Use supabase migrations in code for all db changes.

IMPORTANT! When editing a file change only what you intend to and copy the rest character for character. Do not say // rest of the code unchanged. That deletes the other code in the diff. Also do not do things like change the import syntax because you are changing a color.

Use pnpm instead of npm

We are using shadcn sonner for toasts. It is provided in the root layout.

NextJS imports are '@/' with version 15. Do NOT change import syntax when making code changes!
