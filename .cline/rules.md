This is a starter project of NextJS with Supabase and authentication that we will be turning into an AI assistant

Use shadcn for all visual elements

Use supabase migrations in code for all db changes.

IMPORTANT! When editing a file change only what you intend to and copy the rest character for character. Do not say // rest of the code unchanged. That deletes the other code in the diff. Also do not do things like change the import syntax because you are changing a color.

Use pnpm instead of npm
